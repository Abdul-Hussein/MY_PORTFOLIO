### Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Abdul-Hussein/MYPORTFOLIO.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   After cloning, navigate into the project directory with:
   ```sh
   cd MYPORTFOLIO
   ```

3. **Download and Install XAMPP:**
   - Go to the [XAMPP official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
   - Download the XAMPP installer for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions for XAMPP on your system.

4. **Copy the Project to XAMPP's htdocs Folder:**
   - Locate the `htdocs` folder within the XAMPP installation directory. It is usually found in `C:\xampp\htdocs` on Windows or `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs` on macOS.
   - Copy the `MYPORTFOLIO` folder into the `htdocs` directory.

5. **Run XAMPP and Start Apache and MySQL:**
   - Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
   - Start the Apache and MySQL services.

6. **Open the Project in Your Browser:**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/MYPORTFOLIO`.
   - Replace `MYPORTFOLIO` with the specific file or index page name if needed, e.g., `http://localhost/MYPORTFOLIO/index.php`.

### Additional Configuration (if needed)
- **Database Setup:** If your project requires a database, ensure the SQL database is set up correctly.
  - Open phpMyAdmin (accessible via the XAMPP Control Panel).
  - Create a new database.
  - Import any provided SQL files into your database.
  - Update your project's database configuration file with the correct database name, username, and password.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that XAMPP is running with administrator privileges.
- Make sure no other applications are using the same ports as Apache (default is 80) and MySQL (default is 3306).
- Check your browserâ€™s console and XAMPP logs for any error messages.
